### Crop Yield Prediction: 
Predicts expected crop yield based on input parameters.
### Crop Recommendation: 
Suggests suitable crops based on soil quality and climatic conditions.
### Machine Learning Integration: 
Implements Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms for accurate predictions.
### User-Friendly Interface: 
Provides an intuitive web-based interface for easy access.
### Data Visualization: 
Graphical representation of data for better decision-making.
